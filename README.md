# Protein

![protein](./assets/protein.jpeg)

Protein is a set of libraries:

- `lexer` let you lex a proto file.
- `parser` let you parse a proto file.

## Stage

Protein is in development stage. We welcome contributions (documentation or code).

## Goal

The goal of Protein is to provide you with all the tools you need to write linters, LSPs and other developer tools you need. Just want to parse and not type check? fine. Want to have all the information possible on your proto files? also fine.

## Why Protein?

Most of the tools I encountered provide either a specific tool like a linter, or a full blown compiler. Protein gives you choices. Just choose the tools you need.
